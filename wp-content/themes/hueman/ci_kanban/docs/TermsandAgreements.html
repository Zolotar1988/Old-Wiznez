The unauthorized posting, reproduction, copying, distribution, modification, public display or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes infringement of the copyright owners rights. As a condition to your use of Techpear.com, You agree not to use Techpear.com or any other Techpear Site to infringe the intellectual property rights of others in any way.

We reserve the right to take these actions at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice, and without any liability to the User who is terminated or to the User whose access is blocked.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">10. Techpear&rsquo;s Liability</span><hr></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Techpear.com acts as a venue for employers to post job opportunities and does not screen or censor the listings, including Profiles offered. Techpear is not involved in the actual transaction between employers and candidates. As a result, Techpear has no control over User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or resumes posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings and Techpear makes no representations about any internships or User Content on Techpear.com. Techpear may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such User Content could create liability for Techpear, damage Techpear&#39;s brand or public image. While Techpear reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content, job postings, or other material from Techpear.com, Techpear does not assume any obligation to do so and disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition, note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other Users with whom You come in contact through Techpear.com and/or the other Techpear Sites. By its very nature, other people&#39;s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. We expect that You will use caution and common sense when using Techpear.com and/or the other Techpear Sites.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, Techpear cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because we do not and cannot be involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on any Techpear Site, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release Techpear (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Techpear Sites and the Techpear Content may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors.
